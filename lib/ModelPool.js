/**
 * Turnpike plumbing.
 *
 * On-the-fly creation and caching of model objects with automated garbage
 * collection.
 *
 * Model classes currently cannot take any arguments in their constructor for
 * this to work. Obviously all methods in the model class need to be reentrant
 * as the event loop could very easily call any of your methods any number of
 * times while already in the midst of handling a CRUD request.
 *
 * Under this system, persistent model objects aren't manipulated directly by
 * controllers. Instead, they communicate with controllers by way of data item
 * objects. We don't need a constructor for data items because there are no
 * invariant fields they are expected to have. Their structure depends entirely
 * on the data you will be storing.
