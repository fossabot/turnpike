/**
 * ViewBuilder.
 *
 * Autogenerates a view class on the fly from a collection of Jade templates.
 *
 * Basic concept:
 * ViewBuilder takes a directory path and scans it for template files. Each is
 * assumed to be a display mode for a single view. Every template in a view
 * should take subsets of the same set of variables.
